          <h3>The Brief</h3>
          <p>
            When [Client Name] came to me, they were struggling with low website conversion rates.
            So, I helped them revamp their website, implementing lead-generation strategies and creating a user-friendly design.
            Now they have increased their lead conversions by 40% and their business is thriving with more client inquiries.

          <h3>Testimonial</h3>
          <p>
            Before, I was struggling with a website that wasnâ€™t converting visitors into clients, and it made me feel frustrated and unsure about the future of my business.
            Now, I have a website that generates consistent leads, and I feel empowered knowing my business is growing.
